Incubator for Plumatic Schema features.

### Polymorphic schemas (com.ambrosebs.schema-incubator.poly)

Macros such as `poly/defn` can define functions with polymorphic schemas. At runtime, they will be checked
by expanding polymorphic variables to their most general values. For example, at runtime `identity-mono`
and `identity-poly` are instrumented in the same way:

```clojure
(poly/defn identity-mono :- s/Any
  [x :- s/Any]
  x)

(poly/defn :all [T]
  identity-poly :- T
  [x :- T]
  x)
```

The actual value chosen as the "most general" depends on the polymorphic variables kind and should not be
relied on. In the future, polymorphic variables may be instantiated with other values.

Dotted variables have an internal "most general" value which represents a homogeneous sequence of
generalized templates (ie., generalizing variables to the left of the `:..`).
The following two functions are instrumented in the same way.

```clojure
(poly/defn :all [S T :..]
  rest-args-poly :- S
  [& xs :- {:a S :b T} :.. T]
  x)

(s/defn rest-args-mono :- s/Any
  [& xs :- [{:a s/Any :b s/Any}]]
  x)
```
